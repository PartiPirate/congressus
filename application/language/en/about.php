$lang["about_what_s_opentweetbar_content"] = "Congressus is a web application allowing the proposal of a tweet for a
twitter account community type, its validation by its community and therefore taking a comprehensive
and thoughtful responsibility for communication.<br />
<br />
It allows to handle lists of users, each with a score during validation to give more or less weight to a person for
the validation of a tweet (a spokesperson can have more weight than a member of an association, and it may
take, for example, 3 members for a validation or 1 member and 1 spokesperson).<br />
<br />
The tool also allows to avoid giving everyone access to the managed Twitter account and termination of the rights
of a person no longer involves changing the password of the Twitter account, and finally know who proposed what
and who validated, allowing facilitating your role as a communicator and an editor.";
